"""Report where a .pptx prints text over text, over a shape, or off the slide.

This is the check that stands between a filled deck and the screenshot the
customer sees. Every shape in the MTP templates is sized for the label it
shipped with, so writing a real sentence into a card title grows the text out
of the box and straight over the paragraph underneath it. Nothing errors; the
deck only looks wrong when it is rendered.

Two defects are reported, and the second is the one that actually bites:

* **texto que se sale** - the text needs more lines than the shape is tall and
  the shape has no autofit, so it prints outside the shape.
* **texto sobre texto** - two runs of text land on the same pixels.

Both compare where the glyphs land, not where the boxes are, and that is the
whole trick. Comparing boxes is not enough, and neither is enough on its own:
a shape with `<a:spAutoFit/>` carries a `cy` frozen at the height of its
*original* one-line label, so the rectangle looks fine and the text still grows
over its neighbour. Comparing rendered text against a box whose rectangle is
honest catches it.

Geometry comes from a single `officecli query <deck> slide --json`, which
returns the whole tree in one call, and text is measured with Pillow against
whatever fontconfig resolves the deck's typeface to. Placeholders that carry no
geometry of their own inherit their box from the slide layout - a very common
construction - and officecli does not resolve that inheritance, so those boxes
are read straight out of the `.pptx` (see `inherited_boxes`) instead of being
skipped. Shape coordinates inside
a group are in the group's *child* coordinate space, so they are mapped
through the group's `childOffset`/`childExtent` before anything is compared -
skipping that step invents dozens of overlaps between shapes that are in fact
centimetres apart.

Usage:
    python3 check_overlaps.py deck.pptx [officecli-binary]
    python3 check_overlaps.py deck.pptx --capacity [/slide[N]]
    python3 check_overlaps.py deck.pptx --strict

`--capacity` is the other half: it prints what each shape can hold, so the text
is written to fit rather than measured after the fact.

Exit status is 0 when nothing is wrong and 1 when something is, so it can gate
a delivery.
